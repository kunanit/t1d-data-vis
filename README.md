### Author publication networks
Visualization of author networks in the T1D literature. Individual authors are represented by nodes in the diagram. Node size represents number of last author publications. Wider edge thickness represents more papers copublished between two authors. (Criteria for author inclusion = last author on one of the top 500 cited papers from Web of Science search [type 1 diabetes or diabetes mellitus type 1 or iddm or funding:jdrf])
